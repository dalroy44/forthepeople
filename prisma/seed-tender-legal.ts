// Seeds disclaimer clauses into TenderEducationContent with docType='disclaimer'.
// Run AFTER Vercel's build has applied the new docType + stateSlug columns.
//
//   npx tsx prisma/seed-tender-legal.ts
//
// Idempotent — uses slug as the upsert key. Safe to re-run whenever the
// clauses are edited. Adds:
//   - UNIVERSAL clauses (stateSlug=null): cover GFR 2017, GODL-India,
//     RTI §4, DPDP Act 2023, Advocates Act §33, support contact.
//   - KARNATAKA clauses (stateSlug='karnataka'): KTPPA 1999 notes.
//
// To add a new state's clauses: append rows with stateSlug matching that
// state's slug. Content composes in the disclaimer page — universal first,
// then state-specific.
